    "## Lesson: Exception Handling with try, except, and finally\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Handling Division by Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their division. Use try, except, and finally blocks to handle division by zero and print an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: File Reading with Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that reads the contents of a file named `data.txt`. Use try, except, and finally blocks to handle file not found errors and ensure the file is properly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Handling Multiple Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns their sum. Use try, except, and finally blocks to handle TypeError if a non-integer value is encountered and print an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Exception Handling in User Input\n",

    "### Assignment 6: Nested Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that performs nested exception handling. It should first attempt to convert a string to an integer, and then attempt to divide by that integer. Use nested try, except, and finally blocks to handle ValueError and ZeroDivisionError and print appropriate messages.\n",

    "Write a function that calls another function which may raise an exception. Use try, except, and finally blocks to handle the exception and print an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Exception Handling in Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a class with a method that performs a division operation. Use try, except, and finally blocks within the method to handle division by zero and print an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Exception Handling in Data Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list of strings and converts them to integers. Use try, except, and finally blocks to handle ValueError if a string cannot be converted and print an appropriate message.\n",
