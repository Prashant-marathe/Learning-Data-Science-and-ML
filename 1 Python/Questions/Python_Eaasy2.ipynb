    "### Topic 1: SQLite - Relations and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 1: Database Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a SQLite database named `Inventory.db`.\n",
    "2. Create a table named `products` with columns `product_id` (Primary Key), `product_name` (Not Null), and `price` (Real).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 2: Parameterized Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a parameterized query (using `?` placeholders) to insert two new products into the table.\n",
    "2. Explain why using placeholders is better than using f-strings for SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 3: Data Aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a query to find the average price of all products in the `products` table.\n",
    "2. Fetch and print the result using `fetchone()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic 2: Logging - Advanced Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 4: Custom Formatting**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure logging to include the line number and the function name in the output format.\n",
    "2. Log an `INFO` message from inside a function to demonstrate the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 5: Logging with Exception Tracebacks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `try-except` block for a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "2. Use `logging.exception(\"Message\")` to log the error with the full stack trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 6: Selective Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the logging level to `WARNING`.\n",
    "2. Try logging an `INFO` message and a `CRITICAL` message. Explain which one appears and why.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic 3: Multithreading & Synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 7: Thread Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function that prints \"Task in Progress\" and sleeps for 2 seconds.\n",
    "2. Start this function in a separate thread and print \"Task Finished\" from the main thread immediately after.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 8: Multiple Threads**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch 3 threads that all execute the same function (e.g., printing the thread's name).\n",
    "2. Use a loop to create and start these threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 9: Thread Safety Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define \"Race Condition\" in the context of multithreading.\n",
    "2. Briefly explain how a `Lock` object helps prevent data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic 4: Multiprocessing - Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 10: Process Pooling**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `multiprocessing.Pool` to map a function that calculates the square of a number over a list of 5 integers.\n",
    "2. Print the resulting list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 11: Shared Memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `multiprocessing.Value` to create a shared integer between a parent process and a child process.\n",
    "2. Increment the value in the child process and print it in the parent process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 12: Process Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a process and assign it a custom name (e.g., `\"DataProcessor\"`).\n",
    "2. Inside the process, print the `multiprocessing.current_process().name` to verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic 5: Memory Management & Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 13: The `sys.getrefcount` Tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a simple list object.\n",
    "2. Use the `sys` module to print the current reference count of that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 14: Circular References**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two objects that refer to each other.\n",
    "2. Explain why reference counting alone might fail to delete these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment 15: Manual GC Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `gc` module to manually trigger a garbage collection.\n",
    "2. Print the number of unreachable objects found by the collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to provide the **Python code solutions** for these SQLite and Multiprocessing tasks, or should I create a **Medium Level** set that introduces **Database Joins** and **Thread Pools**?"
