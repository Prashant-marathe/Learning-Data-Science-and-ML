    "##### What is Multithreading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads (lightweight sub-processes) run concurrently within a single process, sharing the same memory space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each thread performs a specific task -- allowing parts of your program to run in parallel (or appear to).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pytho, we use the `threading` module to create and manage threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your program needs to download multiple files or handle multiple network connections, you can use mutithreading to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency: Perform multiple tasks “simultaneously” within one program (e.g., reading files while processing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: Great for I/O-bound tasks — like web scraping, file I/O, and network requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responsiveness: Keeps GUIs or servers responsive while other tasks run in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpler than multiprocessing for lightweight tasks, since all threads share the same memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s not ideal for CPU-bound tasks (like heavy math or ML training) because of the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main process creates one or more threads using the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each thread runs a target function independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Threads share the same memory, so they can read and modify shared variables (requires synchronization).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The operating system switches between threads rapidly, giving an illusion of parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python \n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "t = threading.Thread(target = function_name, args=(arg1, arg2))\n",
    "t.start()\n",
    "t.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "| **target** | The function the thread will execute.                 |\n",
    "| **args**   | Tuple of arguments for the target function.           |\n",
    "| **kwargs** | Dictionary of keyword arguments for the target.       |\n",
    "| **name**   | Name for the thread (optional).                       |\n",
    "| **daemon** | Boolean; if True, thread ends when main program ends. |\n",
