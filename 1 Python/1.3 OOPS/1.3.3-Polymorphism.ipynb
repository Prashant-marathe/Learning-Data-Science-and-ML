    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.\n",

An ABC contains one or more abstract nethods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the base class. Subclasses inheritig from the ABC must implement these abstract methods; otherwose, those subclasses cannot be instantiated. In Python, ABCs are defined using *abc* module and the *@abstractmethod* decorator."

    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implemetation of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can creaate more extensible and maintainable object-oriented programs."
