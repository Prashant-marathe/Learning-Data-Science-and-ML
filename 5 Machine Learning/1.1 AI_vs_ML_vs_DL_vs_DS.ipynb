    "#### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A broad field where machine are designed to simulate human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Make systems that can think, reason, and act like humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**: The umbrella term that covers ML, DL, DS and other intelligent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Self-driving cars\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A subset of AI where machines learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Improve performance automatically through experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**: Uses algorithms that learn patterns from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Spam email detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Predicting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Handle very complex problems using large datasets and high computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**: Great for unstructured data (images, audio, text).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Face recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Voice Assistants\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Data Science (DS):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A multidisciplionary field that focuses on extracting insights from data using statistics, programming, ML, and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: Understand, Visualize, and make decisions from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Analyzing customer trends\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Building Business Dashboards."
