    "\n",
    "Supervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Labeled data = input (features) + correct output (target)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm learns the mapping between input -> output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After training, it can predict outputs for new unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Machine Learning is a type of machine learning where algorithm is trained on unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No predefined outputs/ labels are given\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system tries to find hidden pattens, grouping, or structures withing the data.\n",

    "#### 3. Reinforcement Machine Leaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning paradigm where an agent learns by interacting with an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent takes actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The environment gives rewards or penalties (feedback).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The goal is to learn a policy (stratagy) that maximizes long term rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as learning by trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key components of Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Agent*: Learner/ decision maker (e.g. A robot, A gamebot)\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Environment*: The world the agent interacts with\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. State (s)*: Current situation of the agent in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Action (A)*: Choices the agent can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Reward (R)*: Feedback from the environment after an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Policy (x)*: Strategy that the agent follows to choose actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Value function*: Expected long-term reward from the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positive RL : Rewards for good actions encourage repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Negetive RL: Penalties for bad actions discourage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular RL Algorithms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Value Based: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN)\n",

    "**Advantages Of Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learns complex tasks withour labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can adapt dynamically to environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Great for sequential decision-making problems \n",

    "**Disadvantages of Reinforcement Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
